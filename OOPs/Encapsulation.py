# Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). 
# It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. 
# This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification 
# of data.

# A class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions, variables, etc. 
# The goal of information hiding is to ensure that an object’s state is always valid by controlling access to attributes that are hidden from 
# the outside world.

# Consider a real-life example of encapsulation, in a company, there are different sections like the accounts section, finance section, sales section etc. 
# The finance section handles all the financial transactions and keeps records of all the data related to finance. 
# Similarly, the sales section handles all the sales-related activities and keeps records of all the sales. 
# Now there may arise a situation when due to some reason an official from the finance section needs all the data about sales in a particular month. 
# In this case, he is not allowed to directly access the data of the sales section. He will first have to contact some other officer in the sales section and then request him to give the particular data. 
# This is what encapsulation is.


"""What is Encapsulation in Python Programming?"""
# Encapsulation is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principle that involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. 
# This concept helps hide the internal state of an object from the outside world, providing a controlled interface for interacting with the object’s data and methods.

""" How to Implement Encapsulation in Python Classes?"""
# Encapsulation in Python is implemented using access specifiers to control access to class members:

"""Public Members: By default, attributes and methods are public and can be accessed from outside the class."""
"""Protected Members: Use a single underscore (_) prefix to indicate that an attribute or method is intended for internal use within the class and its subclasses."""
"""Private Members: Use double underscores (__) prefix to make an attribute or method private. This leads to name mangling, making it more challenging to access from outside the class."""


"""" What are Private and Protected Members in Python Classes?"""
"""Private Members: Members with double underscores (__) are private. They are intended to be accessed only within the class where they are defined. Python uses name mangling to make these members harder to access from outside the class."""
"""Protected Members: Members with a single underscore (_) are protected. They are intended for use within the class and its subclasses. This is a convention and does not enforce strict access control."""


"""How Does Encapsulation Benefit Python Code Organization?"""
# 1. Controlled Access: Encapsulation allows controlled access to the internal state of an object, protecting the data from unintended interference.

# 2. Data Hiding: It hides the internal workings of a class, making the implementation details invisible to outside code and reducing the risk of accidental data modification.

# 3. Improved Maintenance: Changes to the internal implementation of a class do not affect code that uses the class, as long as the public interface remains unchanged.

# 4. Enhanced Flexibility: Encapsulation promotes modular design, making it easier to modify or extend functionality without impacting other parts of the program.

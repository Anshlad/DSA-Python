# In Python, the for Loop is In Python, the for loop is used for
# iterating over sequence types such as list, tuple, set, range, etc.

# Example 1: Iterating over a list 1
# nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# for i in nums:
#     print(i)

# Example 2: Iterating over a list 2
# nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# for i in nums:
#     print(i)
#     if i == 20:
#        print("This is my birthday")

# Example 3: Iterating over a list 2
# colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Yellow"]
# for x in colors:
#     print(x)

# Example 4; Iterating over a touple
# nums = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
# for i in nums:
#     print(i)


# Example 5: Iterating over a string 1
# name = 'Bhavesh'
# for i in name:
#     print(i)

# Example 4: Iterating over a string 2
# name = 'Bhavesh'
# for i in name:
#     print(i, end = ",")

# Example 5: Iterating over a Dictionary 1
# numNames= {1: 'One', 2: 'Two', 3: 'Three'}
# for pair in numNames.items():
#     print(numNames)

# Example 4: Iterating over a Dictionary 2
# numNames= {1: 'One', 2: 'Two', 3: 'Three'}
# for k,v in numNames.items():
#     print("key = ", k, "value = ", v)
